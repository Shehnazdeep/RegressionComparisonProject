This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the comparison of multiple regression models on a given dataset. The notebook explores various models like ExtraTreesRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, and XGBRegressor. These models are evaluated based on several performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ², RMSLE, and MAPE.

The goal of this project is to provide insights into how different regression algorithms perform on a particular task, with a focus on predicting continuous variables.
